# Coding standards

## In general
Indentation is everything. If code is not indented properly, it is like trying to make sense of a book without punctuation. Indent with 4 spaces. This can be set in Sublime Text by opening settings (cmd+,) and adding the following lines:

```
"tab_size": 4,
"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
```

## HTML

## CSS

## PHP
### Laravel
#### Extract similar view content to sub views
