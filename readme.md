# Coding standards

## In general
Indentation is everything. If code is not indented properly, it is like trying to make sense of a book without punctuation. Indent with 4 spaces. This can be set in Sublime Text by opening settings (cmd+,) and adding the following lines:

```
"tab_size": 4,
"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
```

Proper indentation should be practised religiously.

## HTML
Not much to say here yet. Remember indentation. Nothing is worse than

```html
    <!-- All kinds of nested divs -->

        </div>    
</div>
    </div>
    </div>
</div>
```


## CSS


## PHP
### Laravel
#### Extract similar view content to sub views
